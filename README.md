## This repository contains:
- Classwise Cross Entropy (code) 
- For simplicity, classification code for visual recognition is provided separately in this [GitHub repo üñ±Ô∏è](https://github.com/unique-chan/Simple-Image-Classification): you can easily use `Classwise Regulated Entropy` by passing `--loss_function='CRE'` for executing `train.py`. For details, please visit the above repository.

## Prerequisites
* See requirements.txt
```
torch
torchvision
```

## Code
```python
### Preparing!!!
